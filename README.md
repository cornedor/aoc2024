# Advent of Code 2024

## Getting started

If you have nix and direnv installed, you can run `direnv allow` to get all dependencies. If you just have nix installed, you can run `nix develop` to get a shell with all dependencies.

If you do not have nix installed, make sure you have a recent version of gleam and erlang installed.

## Running

To run a day, run `gleam run aoc24 day# <path to input>` where # is the day number. 

e.g. save the input to `inputs/day1.txt` and run `aoc24 day1 inputs/day1.txt`
